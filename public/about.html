                I don't think my hobbies are too broad, and I usually like to
                listen to music and watch meaningful films or TV series.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, sometimes I like to go out and play basketball or

              <h1>Basketball</h1>
              <p>
                I started playing basketball when I was in primary school. But
                at that time I didn't put effort in playing it well so it's
                just a way for me to pass the leisure time and playing with my
                friends.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, as I fell in love with watching NBA basketball and
                loved the players in it, I began playing basketball more
                skillfully and competitively.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, I love the sport so much and am willing to spend a lot of
                time working on my shooting and dribbling skills.

              <h1>Football</h1>
              <p>
                I also started playing football when I was in primary school.
                At that time I used to play football with my friends in the
                neighbourhood. I'm also a keen follower of football, and often
                watch the Premier League and Bundesliga matches.
                Unfortunately, there were few opportunities to play the sport
                inside the school, and I grew to be unfamiliar with it.
              </p>
              <p>
                And when I got into college, I found plenty of opportunities
                to play football, and I have started playing it again. I'm not
                a professional player, but I love the sport and enjoy playing
                it with my friends. And now my friends and I often enjoy our
                time playing football, watching football matches and playing
                FIFA games together.

              <h1>Music</h1>
              <p>
                I can easily and happily do anything as long as I'm listening
                to the music I want to hear. At the same time whatever I do, I
                long to be able to do it listening to beautiful music.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think music is a really great and amazing thing. It can make
                people enchanted and forget time, and also can bring all kinds
                of emotions to people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among all kinds of music, my favourites are pop music and R&B.
              </p>
              <p>
                And Adele, Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran are my favourite
                singers.
